#BALL THROW
##Vansh Pahuja

Controls:
WASD to move around

Left Click and Drag to look around

Right click to throw ball


Hit targets on top of the pillars. Collision is checked using distance between centers of ball and targets.

Ball resets if it goes out of bounds or hits a target.

If target is hit, it is moved to the left side of the table so you can keep track of the targets you have hit.

When all the targets are hit, the game ends.
